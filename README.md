<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm AiX 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
I'm a developer at <strong><a href="https://vidmuse.ai/">VidMuse.ai</a></strong>, where I get to help shape the future of storytelling.
</p>

We believe that great ideas shouldn't be limited by complex software or long timelines. Our mission is to put creativity front and center, and I contribute to that by writing the code that brings our AI video agent to life.

- 🚀 **Currently focused on:** Making video creation as simple as writing a sentence.
- 💡 **Interested in:** Generative AI, agentic video, and building products people love.
